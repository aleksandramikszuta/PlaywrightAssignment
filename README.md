# PlaywrightAssignment

Three of the use cases I decided to cover in my assignment are related to basic navigation of the help topics: search (positive + negative case) and navigation via pre-defined topics. These cover the vast majority of the site by end customers and as such are the most vital in a help page in my opinion.

The fourth use case has to do with completing the flow of an end-user, giving feedback after receiving help with a given topic. I also find it interesting that there seems to be a discrepancy between the behaviour of the site between observed behaviour when executing this manually and when exeuting via Playwright, warranting some further interest. To be fully covered, though, this scenario would need to have additional assertions either on the API side or DB entries related to the rating (not just the UI change).
